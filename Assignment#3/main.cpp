    /**------------------------
     A bit on the design:
     ---
     Items are only sotred in the inventory.
     Any other class that requires the use of items, stores item IDs.
     and then access the items from the inventory that is passed by referenc
     whenever is needed.
     ---
     All IDs are auto incremeneted and can not be modified.
     As we are using ID to trace back all our information.
     ---
     
     Registry stores Sale*
     if a sale is added to registry, Registry becomes the owner of that pointer.
     We should not delete the sale our selves anymore, until Registry is done with it
     
     if a sale was not completed and not added to the Registry,
     then we are responsible for deleting that sale.
     ---
     
     In some cases like in the inventory methods, enum Error is returned.
     Which is simply different errors that can be printed using the printError function.
     This can be improved by using Exceptions
     ---
     
     ApprovedAuthority uses a C++ random generator. I'd advice everyone to learn how to use it.
     It's a much better random generator than the C rand();
     ---
     
     Instead of having multiple functions for getting the price, with tax/without tax, with PaymentType/Without
     I used one function that takes a bool to specofy the price I want to get.
     Which works well to not recheck every time the conditions yourselves and get the right price.
     In this case you just pass the bool to the other functions.
     ---
     
     Testing every little step as you are implementing is very important.
     It doesn't matter how good you are, you will always have bugs.
     In case you find bugs in my implementation please report it to me to fix it
